# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to help Louise determine how well other compaigns did in accomplishing their fundraising goals. Raw data obtained by Louise was sorted and analyzed to help fulfill this purpose.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In order to analyze the outcomes of each campaign, based on the launch date, the initial step was to filter the data so the outcomes present were only of campaigns falling under the "Theatre" campaign. Implementing this filter was necessary to ensure only data relevant to Louise's own findings was present. When comparing the outcomes based on the launch dates, it is visible that campaigns launching from April-August had a higher success rate in reaching their goals. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
