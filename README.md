# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to help Louise determine how well other compaigns did in accomplishing their fundraising goals. Raw data obtained by Louise was sorted and analyzed to help fulfill this purpose.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The year of creation for each campaign was retrieved from the unix format in Louise's raw data table, and further added as its own column. From there, a pivot table was created to show the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns in each month. The pivot table had to be filtered so the outcomes present were only of campaigns falling under the "Theatre" category. Implementing this filter was necessary to ensure only data relevant to Louise's own findings was present. The data was sorted in descending order and used to create a line chart for ease in analysis. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Due to the goals of the campaigns falling under a relatively large range, twelve smaller ranges were created to better divide and visualize the raw data. From there, the number of successful, failed, and canceled compaigns pertaining to plays, falling under each goal range, were calculated and added to a separate table. Campaigns pertaining to plays were only used to ensure data was relavent to Louise's own campaign fundraiser. From the new table, percentage of successful, failed, and canceled compaigns in each range were calculated and shown in a line chart for ease in analysis. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

When comparing the outcomes based on the launch dates, it is visible that campaigns launching from April-August had a higher success rate in reaching their goals, with the highest success rates being in May and June. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
